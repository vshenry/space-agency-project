Simple website that utilizes Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL databases to display and sort data based on user input.

The most challenging part of this project was implementing JavaScript search and sort methods. Since JS is the programming language I have the least knowledge in, figuring out how to use it was an uphill battle. I was able to figure out the syntax and implimentation by going over several examples I found online, as well as several youtube videos explaining the process. The final hirdle was making the JS update for each newly opened page without having the user have to manually refresh the page. This also took a while to solve.

Another challenge I faced was dealing with issues with the databases. At times the databses would fail to migrate, seed, or update, most likely due to error on my part. After trial and error I remade these databases, and re-seeded and re-migrated them both. 

The CSS styling is simple with a cool-colored motif. Nothing too detailed, just enough to make it nice to look at.
